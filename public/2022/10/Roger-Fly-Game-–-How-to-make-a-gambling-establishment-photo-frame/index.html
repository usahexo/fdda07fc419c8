We used a high grit sandpaper to distress the edges of the wood after painting. This gave it an aged look. Step 3: Cut the Plywood Sheet The plywood sheet will be used to create the back of the photo frame. Measure and mark the dimensions on the plywood sheet, then use a circular saw to cut it out. We also used a high grit sandpaper to distress the edges of the plywood after cutting it. Step 4: Assemble the Back Panel of the Frame Now that we have all of our pieces cut, it’s time to assemble them into the photo frame. Start by attaching one end of a stile to one end of a rail with a Brad nail using a cordless drill with Phillips head bit . Repeat this process for each end of both the stiles and rails until you have created a rectangular panel. Make sure everything is flush and square before nailing it in place. Step 5: Attachthe Plywood Sheet Next, we attached the plywood sheet to the back panel using Brad nails . We predrilled holes before nailing it in place so that it would be secure. Step 6: Add Finishing Touches Now it’s time to add some finishing touches! We used black spray paint to give our photo frame a glossy finish . We then added some vinyl lettering that says “Roger Fly Game” using transfer paper . And that’s it! Our Roger Fly Game photo frame is finished!</p>
