#  How to Memorize Basic Strategy for Blackjack

In order to memorize the basic strategy for blackjack, there are a few things you need to understand about the game. Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the dealer to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. The player with the highest total score wins the hand.

In blackjack, players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt one card face down and one card face up. The aim of the game is to draw cards until your total is as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards (King, Queen and Jack) are worth 10 points each and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand. The other cards are worth their number value.

If you have a total of 16 or less, you should always hit (take another card). If you have a total of 17 or more, you should always stand (stick with the current total). If you are unsure what to do, you can use basic strategy charts to help you make the best decision for every possible situation.

Once you have memorized the basic strategy for blackjack, playing the game becomes much easier. You’ll know exactly when to hit and when to stand, which gives you a better chance of winning against the dealer.

Come up with your own acronym or phrase to help you remember the different parts of basic strategy.
