#  Get a taste of the high-action Brazilian underworld in Baccarat Brasileiro Serie A

The thrill of the high-stakes Brazilian baccarat game is one that cannot be matched by any other casino game. Serié A is the most popular variation of this fast-paced and exciting game, and it is played with eight decks of cards.

Before playing Serié A, you should first learn the basic rules. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting a score of nine or closer, or by having a higher score than the dealer. Cards numbered two through nine are worth their face value, while face cards are worth ten points each and aces are worth either one or eleven points, depending on which would give you the best hand. After both players have bet, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to himself. The player with the highest hand starts first and play passes clockwise around the table.

You can either stand on your current total or ask for another card (known as drawing). If you go over 21, you bust and automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. If both you and the dealer have identical hands, it is called a tie and neither player wins nor loses money. The first player to get to or beyond 21 points wins the hand.

In Serié A, each card is dealt face up, so players can see what others are holding. This speeds up gameplay considerably and heightens the excitement even more! There are also different betting options available in Serié A, including betting on yourself, betting on the dealer, or splitting your bet between playing against the dealer and playing against yourself.

If you're looking for a high-action game that will keep you on your toes, then Serié A is definitely for you! With its fast pace and endless potential for big payouts, it's no wonder why this version of baccarat is so popular in Brazil. So come experience all that Serié A has to offer – you won't be disappointed!
