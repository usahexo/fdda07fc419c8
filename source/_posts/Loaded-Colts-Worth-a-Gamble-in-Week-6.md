#  Loaded Colts Worth a Gamble in Week 6

For fantasy football owners, Week 6 presents an interesting opportunity to gamble on a few Indianapolis Colts players. The Colts come into the week with the most favorable matchup of any team, facing off against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Quarterback Jacoby Brissett is coming off of a stellar performance in Week 5 against the New England Patriots, throwing for 275 yards and two touchdowns. While he is not a high-end option, he could be worth a start this week as a low-end QB1.

Wide receiver T.Y. Hilton had a disappointing game in Week 5, catching only four of his 10 targets for 50 yards. However, he should see plenty of targets against the Jaguars' secondary and is worth starting as a WR2.

Running back Marlon Mack has been very inconsistent this season but could be in for a big game this week against the Jaguars' weak run defense. He is a risky play but could be worth starting as a flex player if you are desperate.

The Colts' defense has been one of the best in the league so far this season and should be able to take advantage of the Jaguars' poor offense. Fantasy owners can start them as a low-end defensive unit this week.

#  Colts Look to Bounce Back After Tough Loss

Coming into the season, the Indianapolis Colts were one of the favorites to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. However, after a tough loss to the Buffalo Bills, they now sit at 1-3 and are looking to bounce back.

The Colts have been plagued by injuries this season, most notably to quarterback Andrew Luck. Backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett has done a admirable job filling in for Luck, but he is also now dealing with an injury. This has led to some concerns about the Colts’ depth at quarterback.

The good news for the Colts is that they have one of the best defenses in the NFL. Led by edge rusher Darius Leonard, they have been able to generate a lot of pressure on opposing quarterbacks. They will need to continue to play well if they want to make a playoff run.

The Colts will next face the Houston Texans, who are also 1-3 on the season. This will be a tough matchup for both teams, and it is important for the Colts to win this game if they want to stay in contention for the playoffs.

#  Judge These NFL Picks at Your Own Risk: The Colts Are for Real

You might be wondering if you should pick the Indianapolis Colts to win this weekend. After all, they are the underdog in this matchup. But according to recent stats, the Colts are looking pretty strong and could very well pull off a win.

Quarterback Andrew Luck is having an impressive season so far, with 20 touchdowns and over 2,500 passing yards. Wide receiver T.Y. Hilton is also having a great year, with 9 touchdowns and over 1,000 receiving yards. The Colts’ backfield is led by Marlon Mack who has averaged 4.8 yards per carry this season.

The Rams have been playing well this year too, but they may not be able to keep up with the Colts’ offensive firepower. Look for Indianapolis to take this game home with a victory.

#  Betting Odds Show Indianapolis Colts as Heavy Favorites Heading into Monday Night Football

The Indianapolis Colts are listed as heavy favorites (-7) for their Monday night matchup against the New York Jets, according to betting odds from [website name].

The Colts (3-6) come into the game having lost four of their last five games, with their only win in that span coming against the lowly Buffalo Bills. Despite their poor form, they are still considered 7-point favorites against a Jets team (3-7) that has just one win in its past six games.

The Jets put up a good fight against the New England Patriots last week but ultimately came up short, losing 27-13. They will need to play much better if they want to stand any chance of upsetting the Colts on Monday night.

Quarterback Andrew Luck has been struggling for the Colts this season, throwing more interceptions (15) than touchdowns (10). However, he should have an easier time against a Jets defense that ranks near the bottom of the league in both points allowed and passing yards allowed.

Running back Marlon Mack may also be poised for a big game, as the Jets have struggled to stop opposing running backs all year long. In fact, they have given up an average of over 125 rushing yards per game in 2018.

If you’re looking to place a bet on this game, the Colts would appear to be a safe bet. However, don’t count out the Jets just yet – they have shown glimpses of potential and could pull off an upset if they play well enough on Monday night.

#  Upset Alert? Browns Could Pull Off Major Stunner Against Colts

The Cleveland Browns have not had the best season. In fact, they are one of the worst teams in the NFL. However, they could pull off a major upset against the Indianapolis Colts this weekend.

The Browns are coming into this game with a lot of momentum. They have won their last two games, and they have looked much better than they did earlier in the season. The Colts, on the other hand, have been inconsistent this year. They have lost their last two games, and they are facing some major injuries heading into this game.

The Colts are missing several key players on both sides of the ball. The most notable injury is to their quarterback Andrew Luck. He is out for the season with a shoulder injury. Other key players who are out for this game include cornerback Vontae Davis and linebacker Jon Bostic.

The Browns will need to take advantage of these injuries if they want to pull off the upset. They will need to establish a strong running game early on, and they will need to keep QB Kevin Hogan protected against a strong Colts defense. If they can do that, they have a chance of pulling off the upset.

Many experts are picking the Colts to win this game easily. However, I believe that the Browns have a real chance of winning. They are playing at home, and they seem to be gaining momentum heading into this game. The Colts are clearly banged up, and I think that will be too much for them to overcome. I am picking the Browns to win this game by 10 points or more.
