#  NJ Sports Betting Picks Up Steam Following Legalization

For the better part of two decades, sports betting has been a murky legal area in New Jersey. That all changed in June 2018, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, overturning a federal ban on sports betting.

This past weekend was the first weekend since the legalization that NJ residents were able to place bets on sports teams. The results were impressive, with over $16 million in total bets placed.

There is no doubt that this number will continue to grow in the coming weeks and months,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) as more and more people become comfortable with the idea of gambling on sports.

One of the biggest questions facing New Jersey now is how to best regulate and tax this new industry. There are a lot of different ways to go about it, and it will be interesting to see which option the state legislature ultimately chooses.

While there are certainly some concerns about the implications of legalized sports betting, there is no doubt that it will be a boon for the state's economy. And with millions of dollars already being wagered each weekend, it's clear that there is a lot of interest in this new form of gambling.

#  Delaware Sports Betting Continues to Boom

As Delaware sports betting continues to boom, operators in the state are gearing up for what is expected to be a very busy holiday season.

Delaware Park spokesperson Gary Truitt said that business has been brisk since the casino began taking sports bets in June, and that things have only heated up in recent weeks.

"Since football season started, we've seen a significant increase in the amount of business that's being done," Truitt said. "We're definitely on target for where we want to be."

Delaware Park isn't the only casino seeing growth thanks to sports betting; Dover Downs Hotel & Casino has also seen significant increases in business. Vice President and General Manager of Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, Michael Tatoian, said that the casino has seen a 30 percent increase in business since it began taking sports bets in September.

"It was a great decision for us," Tatoian said. "It's something our guests have really responded well to."

Tatoian added that the casino is expecting even more business during this year's holiday season, thanks in part to the fact that people can now place bets on NFL games on Sundays.

Sports betting has been a major boon for Delaware's casinos; according to officials from the Delaware Lottery, revenue from sports betting increased by $7 million between July and September. That's an impressive increase, given that Delaware only began taking sports bets in June.

The state's success with sports betting is likely due to several factors; first, Delaware was one of the first states to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned PASPA in May. Additionally, the state has a relatively small population (just under 1 million), which means there is less competition for gambling dollars. Finally, Delaware offers some of the best odds on NFL games in the country.

State officials are hoping that this success will continue into 2019 and beyond; Governor John Carney recently announced plans to invest $9 million into marketing efforts aimed at promoting Delaware's casino industry. The money will be used to promote both casinos and horse racing tracks in the state, as well as online gaming sites operated by Delaware Park and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino.

#  New York Sports Betting Struggles to Get Off the Ground

A recent study by the American Gaming Association found that only 33 percent of Americans support legalizing sports betting, down from 47 percent in September 2017. This is despite the fact that 68 percent of Americans think that professional athletes are using performance-enhancing drugs.

One reason for this decline may be the perception that legalizing sports betting will create more problems than it solves. For example, many people worry that legalized sports betting could lead to match fixing and other forms of corruption in professional sports. Others are concerned that it will increase addiction rates and lead to more financial hardship for people who can’t afford to bet.

Legalizing sports betting is also a complex issue because different states have different laws governing gambling. For example, some states allow casinos while others don’t. Some states allow lotteries while others don’t. Some states allow online gambling while others don’t. It’s not clear how lawmakers would go about creating a federal framework for legalized sports betting that would take into account all of these differences.

Despite these concerns, many people believe that legalizing sports betting is inevitable. After all, several states have already moved to legalize it, and the Supreme Court recently struck down a law prohibiting it nationwide. It’s likely that we will see more states move to legalize sports betting in the coming years.

#  California Sports Betting Nears Launch Date

After a prolonged debate that included strong opposition from some of the state’s leading tribal casino operators, California is on the verge of launching a sports betting market.

The state’s lawmakers finalized regulations for the industry at the end of June, and Governor Jerry Brown has until September 30 to sign them into law. It’s expected that he will do so, setting in motion a process that would see sportsbooks open for business by the start of 2019.

Once live, California will become the largest regulated sports betting market in North America, with estimates of up to $7.4 billion in annual handle. That’s about twice as large as Nevada currently enjoys.

The regulations approved by lawmakers include a 15% tax on gaming revenue, as well as provisions aimed at preventing underage betting and problem gambling. They also authorize the state lottery to offer online sports betting.

Tribal casino operators had initially pushed for a more restrictive regulatory framework, one that would have given them exclusive rights to operate sportsbooks in California. They eventually relented, however, after it became clear that they would not be able to block the legislation altogether.

Now that regulation is in place, it will be up to the individual tribes to decide whether they want to offer sports betting at their casinos. Some are expected to do so while others are likely to sit out the market altogether.

One thing that is certain is that there will be plenty of competition among operators. Large Las Vegas companies like MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment are expected to get into the fray, as are several East Coast-based firms like DraftKings and FanDuel.

#  Nevada Leads the Way in Sports Betting

Nevada has always been at the forefront of gaming and entertainment, and the state’s sports betting industry is no exception. In fact, Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting in 1949.

Today, Nevada’s sports betting industry is thriving. The state’s casinos offer a wide variety of sports betting options, including traditional wagers on individual games or matchups, as well as more innovative bets such as prop bets and parlays.

Nevada’s casinos also offer a variety of betting limits, so that both novice and experienced sports bettors can find an option that suits their needs. And thanks to the state’s sophisticated gaming infrastructure, players can place their bets quickly and easily online or in person.

In addition to its well-developed sports betting industry, Nevada also offers a wide range of other gambling options. The state’s casinos offer slot machines, table games, and poker rooms, and there are also numerous racetracks and off-track betting facilities throughout the state.

So if you’re looking for a great gambling experience, Nevada should be at the top of your list. With its world-class casinos and comprehensive gambling offerings, the Silver State is sure to please even the most discerning gambler.
