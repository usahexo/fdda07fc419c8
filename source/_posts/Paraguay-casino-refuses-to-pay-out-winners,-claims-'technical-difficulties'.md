#  Paraguay casino refuses to pay out winners, claims 'technical difficulties'

The Grand Casino in Asunción, Paraguay is in the middle of a controversy after reportedly refusing to pay out several winners, citing "technical difficulties." Local media report that at least three people have been denied their winnings, with casino staff telling them that the machines "aren't working."

This is not the first time the casino has been in the news. In May of this year, it made headlines after another group of winners were refused their prize money. And in 2016, it made national headlines when a man committed suicide after losing his life savings at the casino.

The Grand Casino has come under fire in the past for its poor customer service and aggressive marketing tactics. In 2015, a local woman filed a complaint with authorities after she said she was harassed by casino staff into spending more than $1,000 she couldn't afford.

In a statement released on social media, the Grand Casino defended its decision to withhold payments, saying that it is doing so "due to some technical difficulties with some of our gaming machines." The casino offered no further explanation and did not say how long the problem would take to fix.

Critics are not buying this explanation and say that the casino is simply trying to dodge its responsibilities. They note that the casino has had plenty of time to address any technical issues and are calling for an investigation into why these payments are being withheld.

#  Casino in Paraguay denies payout due to 'internal issues'

An electronic casino in Paraguay has refused to pay out over $250,000 in winnings to a player, citing "internal issues" as the reason.

The player, who has not been identified, said he had been gambling at the casino for two years and had never had a problem before. On March 21st, he hit a jackpot worth 274,290,000 guaranies (about $54,580 USD).

However, when he went to collect his winnings, he was told by casino management that there were "internal issues" and that the payout would not be processed. The player said he was "shocked" by the refusal and has filed a complaint with the local authorities.

Casino management has not commented on the issue.

#  Winner of $580,000 denied payout from Paraguay casino

A casino in Paraguay has denied a payout to a winner who claims that he has hit the jackpot on a slot machine. The man, identified as Mario, was playing at the Casino Club Hipódromo when he says he hit the winning combination.

According to Mario, he put in 800 pesos (about $US16) and hit the jackpot on the machine, which should have paid out 580,000 pesos (nearly $US11,500). However, the casino has said that there is no evidence that Mario ever won the jackpot and has refused to pay out.

Mario says that he has witnesses who can attest to his win, but the casino is refusing to listen. He has now filed a complaint with local authorities in an effort to get his payout.

It's not clear why the casino is denying Mario his payout, but it could be because of something as simple as a technical error on the machine. However, given that casinos are often known for being less than scrupulous in their dealings with customers, it's possible that there is more to this story than meets the eye.

In any case, it's a good idea to be very careful when gambling in Paraguay and to read through all of the terms and conditions before putting any money down.

#  Casino in Paraguay rejects claims, says no foul play involved in withholding payouts

The management of the casino in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, has stoutly rejected allegations of any wrongdoing in connection with the withholding of payouts from some players. The casino claims that all payments were made in accordance with the rules and procedures in place, and that no foul play was involved.

A spokesman for the casino said that all players were given a chance to withdraw their funds before the games were suspended. He added that the casino is now investigating the matter and that anyone with information should come forward.

The allegations surfaced after a group of players complained that they had not been paid their winnings. The group said that they had won around $200,000 in total, but only received a fraction of that amount. They also accused the casino management of deliberately changing the rules after they had started playing so as to prevent them from winning any further payouts.

However, the casino management denies all these charges and insists that it acted fairly at all times. It is currently trying to determine what went wrong and promises to make things right for those affected by this situation.

#  Why didn't the casino in Paraguay pay out its winners?

In a stunning turn of events, the casino in Paraguay refused to pay out its winners, leaving many people stranded with worthless chips. This has left many people wondering what could have caused such an event, and whether or not they will ever receive their winnings.

While the casino has yet to offer a public statement about the incident, there are several theories circulating as to why they would refuse to pay out their winners. One theory is that the casino was having financial difficulties and was trying to avoid paying out any large sums of money. Another theory is that there was some sort of cheating or scam going on at the casino, and the owners were trying to cover it up.

Whatever the reason may be, the casino's decision has left many people angry and disappointed. Some have even threatened to sue, though it remains to be seen if anything will come of those threats. For now, all we can do is wait and see what the casino decides to do.
