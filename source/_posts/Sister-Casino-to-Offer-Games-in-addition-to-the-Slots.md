#  Sister Casino to Offer Games in addition to the Slots?

The Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh has long been a popular spot for slot machine play, thanks to its location just outside of the city and the wide variety of games on offer. But it looks like that could all be about to change, as officials from the casino have recently confirmed plans to add table games to the mix.

If all goes according to plan, the casino will soon offer blackjack, roulette and poker games in addition to its hundreds of slot machines. This would make it one of only a handful of sister casinos in the US to do so, putting it in line with venues such as Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut.

What Does This Mean for Players?

For players, this move could mean big things. Not only will they now have even more options when it comes to gambling at the Rivers Casino, but they could also find themselves winning bigger jackpots. Table games typically offer better payouts than slots, making them a more attractive proposition for high rollers and serious gamblers.

At present, there’s no set timeframe for when these new table games will go live at the casino. However, we can expect that work on installing them – as well as training staff – is already well underway. So keep an eye out for updates in the coming months!

#  Will City Gaming Bring More Revenue to the Sister Casino?

A new casino is expected to open in the spring of 2019 in the small city of Sister, which is located in the eastern part of the state. The new $15 million casino is a joint venture between two tribes, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians and the Confederated Tribes of Grande Ronde.

The tribe that owns the casino, Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, already has a gaming facility near Roseburg, which is about an hour away from Sister. They are expecting that the new casino will bring in more revenue for their tribe. The revenue from gaming is split between the state and tribes, so it's not just the tribes who benefit from this type of revenue stream.

The Confederated Tribes of Grande Ronde operates a casino near Portland, Oregon. They are also expecting that their new casino in Sister will bring in more revenue for their tribe. The revenue from this casino will be used to help fund social services and other important programs for their tribe members.

There are some people who are opposed to casinos because they think that they are dangerous and addictive. However, there is evidence that shows that casinos can be beneficial to both the tribes who own them and to the states where they are located.

Casinos provide much-needed jobs for tribal members as well as for people living in nearby communities. They also generate revenue for states and tribes through taxes and fees. This money can be used to fund important programs and services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects.

The new casino in Sister is expected to create around 100 jobs. It will also generate around $1 million per year in tax revenue for the state and tribes. This money will be used to benefit tribal members and residents of nearby communities.

#  Sister Casino to Roll Out its First Table Games in time for the Holidays?

The management of Sister Casino has long been contemplating the introduction of table games to its property, and it looks like that decision may come sooner rather than later.

# Sister Casino officials would not confirm or deny these reports when reached for comment but insiders say that the table game rollout could happen as early as the end of this year in time for the holiday season.

# If this is true, it will give Sister Casino a major edge over its competitors who have mostly stayed away from table games. Slot Machines have been doing well for Sister Casino but Table Games can be even more lucrative, especially when played by high rollers.

# The addition of Table Games would also bring more jobs to the area as dealers and other support staff would be needed. This is always a good thing, especially in these tough economic times.
