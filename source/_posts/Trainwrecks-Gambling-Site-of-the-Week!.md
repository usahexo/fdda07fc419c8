#  Trainwrecks Gambling Site of the Week!

This week’s unlucky gambling site is Trainwrecks!

Trainwreckz has had a rough go of it lately. First, they were caught up in the fallout from the BetCRIS sportsbook scandal. This led to a number of players having their funds frozen.

However, that’s just the beginning of Trainwreckz’s problems. Their casino software has been glitchy, with players reporting that they’ve been losing money on seemingly fair games.

In addition, their customer service has been completely unresponsive, with players waiting weeks for a response to even the simplest question.

It’s no wonder that Trainwreckz has seen its traffic plummet in recent months. Players would be wise to avoid this site until it can get its act together.
